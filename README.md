# CloudBurst
This is a note taking web extension designed to be simple, yet powerful - featuring a clean UI and intuitive controls.
Currently still in development and sporting a temporary design - to be released in the coming months on the Chrome Web Store.

# Overview
The notes extension works by simply clicking the extension button in the browser, and a popup will appear with CloudBurst. You view one note at a time, each sporting a customizable title. You can have as many notes as you like, which you can navigate with the notes bar on the side.
